            <h3>current saltwater setup: 29 gal Reef

            </h3>
            
           
            <p>
                29 gallon breeder wasnt my first choice for a reef, but I've learned to love this one. My reefing journey is almost synonymous with my love of the aquarium hobby at this point. I spent many years wondering why my ten gallon reefs werent working out, only to come to realize that I was going WAY too fast and trying way too hard. Through this time I battled aiptastia and brown ick galore, not to mention all the critters that were subject to my ignorance. I have never done anything by the book, but there is so much information out there that it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the dosing, testing, and livestocking possibilities.

                I find myself giving advice I hated more than anything at this point-BE PATIENT- It's hard staring at an empty tank for months when all you want to do is grow the best corals in all the land. One of the beauties about the saltwater hobby is how things truly sweeten with time. Espectially if you are starting with dry or DEAD material, you are in for a long haul. It helps to have a contact in the hobby to start a tank but it sure is fullfilling to seed a tank over time. It becomes its own ecosystem with an ecological heierchy. while hitchhikers are a very bad deal and could take out a tank, I've been very pleased with the critter colony I've built up with this reef.

                There is a massive colony of bloodworms wigglin in there, some snails, a variety of pod species, chaleurpa, lots of algae species, spaghetti worms, feather dusters and more than likely all kinds of stuff I have no awareness of. While I do seem to have a massive bubble algae situation, I dont have any problem with it. I 'll let the new filtration work over time and employ the services of some livestock to hopefully balance things out.

                As of creating this area of the website, spell check didnt exist and the reef is running with a DIY PVC OVERFLOW and Return Pump setup with a Phlizon black box LED on a timer. two cycles of 5 hours a day. I run a very natural setup on all my tanks, which of course means i rarely test waters once things are running. Shoot for tank happiness. dont focus too much on all the "Rules" people post on the internet. be patient and just listen to what your specific tank needs. most of the time consistency is the best solution. ive found that most corals and livestock that survived a constistently bad situation ended up being lost to a sudden change made in hopes of fixing something.
