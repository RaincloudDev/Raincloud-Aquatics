            <h1>Paludarium Central</h1>
            <p>
                Paludariums have always fascinated me, but like many things seemed way too daunting to take on a build- Until I just did it. I have been prototyping my dream build for years, and it always includes live stuff sticking out of the tank. I love island scapes and drool over mangroves. A Paludarium seemed like the only logical next step in my journey, and I was off to the workshop. 
            </p>
            
           
            <h3>
                My current Paludarium Setup:
                32 gallon biocube Paludarium            
            </h3>
            <p>
                My paludarium is built from an old 32 gallon Biocube. I drilled holes in the sump wall (well... I used a woodburner..) to restrict the flow to 2/3 chambers. I came to this decision through the need to keep a low water level and the obsession with making use of the sump chambers. I ended up using a small water pump in the original return chamber, and the holes are placed so the water flows up through filter media before overflowing into the return chamber. The water returns through the original inlet, pouring over a large bit of driftwood. This was the aim of the design. I got my trickle waterfall. Natural filtration is very important to my setups, and this paludarium pulls from natural pond filtration. The wood becomes a natural biofilter and will end up becoming host to some juicy slimes that will supercharge the natural biofilter. Most of the non-aquatic plants in this system live on the driftwood in one way or another. Aloe, Devils Walking Stick and Grandma's succulent are beginning to claim their place on the driftwood and rooting in nicely.                 <p>
                At this point we had a few plants sticking out of the back, and started to plant things we got from petsmart like Water Wysteria, etc. Things would boom and die off as the overall cycle set in on the tank.  There was once a group of 30 or so guppies that had worked up, and unfortunately we lost all but three in a big crash. currently we are standing at 3 guppies, 1 cory cat, at least 1 pleco, and many Blue Shrimps and snails. There are even a few freshwater clams who seem to be thriving!

                Our Double-Headed Ressurection Fern came home with a few unknown hitchikers, which have been a joy to watch through their growth. The fern has settled into a sort of amphibious state, thriving in its spot like an anemone. It's obvious that the head closest to the light is living its best life, and the other is doing very well. These ferns are a big part of my life, they were a staple in the home of a dear friend where I spent many years learning about life. When I see a Ressurection Fern, I send love to family, living and lost.

                The up and coming stars of the Plaudarium are the carnivorous plants! A Pitcher Plant and a few Venus Fly traps are semi-submerged to appease their bog needs. They do very well to catch the occasional flying insect! The flow in this tank is notoriously low, we've admittedly had a few outbreaks during the cycling process. A single Guppy patrols the waters accompanied by a small band of blue shrimp. Together they form a team of tiny exterminators! The plants do their part to work on the flyers while the fish work in the water, laying seige to all life stages!

                Aquatic Plants aren't really the focus of this Paludarium, but there are a few scattered about, including a vary happy Red Tiger Lotus bulb. I was delighted to find a volunteer Lotus plant in the paludarium along the way. The plant popped up under the driftwood, of all places. I was very excited to find this plant, considering the substrate had been sitting in a bucket draining for months, and I went on to plant the rest of the tank.

                This project has been very satisfying to me. The colors are fantastic. The greens in the open air aren't like the ones that come from underwater plants, which is just so refreshing. Ours is set up in the kitchen, so it gets sunlight all day in addition to the stock Biocube light fixture. I look forward to seeing this one grow and learning everything I can along the way.
