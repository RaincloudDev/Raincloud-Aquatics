                <p>We've all seen the PVC overflows all on the internet. There seem to be so many variations it can be overwhelming. I've been fascinated
                    by the idea of building one for myself for years, but only just now worked up the motivation to make it happen! My reef is about two years old at this point,
                                      boasting a display capacity of 29 gallons. It was a tank I bought a few years ago at Petco during the famous dollar a gallon sale. It's been a side tank for most of the time ive owned it, stepping in for other tanks failing, etc. This is actually the second time this tank has seen this reef! The reef was started in a 10 gallon tank, which was moved into the current tank after a couple months in preparation for the REAL move. I put it all in a 55 gallon tank that was everything I dreamed of. of course it sprung a leak, so back into the 29 breeder! This tank turned out to be a really nice size. I would love to get it back into the 55, as the stand is originally built for that tank. I did some repairs on the leaks but just dont trust it enough to put the reef back in yet.

                    This brings me to the subject of todays bit. The DIY PVC OVERFLOW. It turned out to be one of those intimidating builds that made perfect sense once I started building. You want to pay attention to the inner diameter of the pipe you're using to make sure you have no flow issues. I lucked out and the pump I used matched my overflow siphon almost exactly. As of writing this, the overflow has been active and stable for 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started with one 10 foot length of 3/4'od PVC and a few fittings. you could easily get away with using 8' or even 6', depending on your build. and of course, the diameter of the tube should be matched to your needs. For the weir, I used 1.5" PVC with one end capped. The area that does the skimming is a simple coupling with slots cut into it. This "Intake Skimmer" is one of the tuneable aspects of the overflow system. The diameter of the pipe used to construct the overall system determines the maximum amount of flow, etc, and the Skimmer Intake determines how fast the Weir refills itself. The level inside the weir provides the system with head pressure that assists the siphon, according to my working observations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The weir sits inside my tank, held against the intake tube (which is cut and slotted for flow) by the air inside the tube. The air is the result of the water level inside the weir. This level is determined by the balance of intake:outflow. A figure ive seen is that 3/4 inch PVC has been rated at a max of 220gph in this application, but have no record of my flow rates. I am using a pump from a 32 gallon BioCube. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intake tube takes water up and over the tank's edge from the bottom of the weir to the intake side of the sump. The Sump is where extra filtration or aquarium gear can go. Adding a sump or refugium increases your water volume, as well. This is desireable for overall stability. The overflow bends over the edge of the tank using two 90 degree fittings. On the top side of this bend, place a one-way air valve. this is used to start the system once its filled with water. Another 180 degree bend is placed BELOW the intake level. immediately after, a Tee is placed where the output is ABOVE the intake level. Mine is JUST ABOVE the end of the intake tube. In the vertival connector place another length of PVC that goes ABOVE the bend over the edge of the tank. this is used to fill the system with water before starting the syphon.

                        <p>Suck the air out of the top of the overflow, and in turn start the siphon.</p>

                        <p>Now that the Siphon has beet started, begin return flow to the display tank</p>
                        <li class="siphonList"><h3>Adjust as Needed</h3></li>
                        <p>Adjust flow as needed. The siphon will stop if there is too little flow and the display tank will overflow into the floor if there is too much return flow.
