            <h1>Freshwater Central</h1>
            <p>freshwater aquariums were, as they were for many, my introduction into the aquarium hobby. the tanks I grew up around were often community tanks with an emphasis on guppys and angels. My dad taught me about things like guppy breeding, general fish lore and how to make sure the water was right. I understand water chemistry but still have a hard time forcing myself to loom over it and test regularly. On the other hand, guppies became my favorite fish to keep, and are a staple in my freshwater systems. They're even in the paludarium! We didnt keep many plants in the aquarium as far as I remember, that part of my obsession must have come later. I remember having guppies and mollies and doing the whole breederbox process, eagerly waiting to see the live babies pour out of the poor mother.

                Through life I have started countless aquatic projects in all shapes. I once kept a tupperware full of water in my bedroom that housed some ground cover, a tiger lotus and a few goldfish. I slept on the floor but I had my koipond! Looking back I guess i've been more interested in aquariums than I realized, and I'm glad its still a part of my life.             </p>

                My current Freshwater Setup:
                36 gallon hex front, Planted, No Filter            
            </h3>
            <p>
                This Tank is about a year and a half old. It, like the 29gal Reef, was started in a 10 gallon tank. It had some of the current driftwood, a large quartz rock, and fertilized substrate. the substrate was organic potting soil held down with the current gravels. When I do it again I'll be sure to use more gravels to create a better barrier and/or focus on sourcing some reccomended aquarium dirt. It was a hot mess. Of course we started in the dreaded ten gallon, so water changes were only doing so much. Luckily we're on good well water so we rarely have to worry about raw water conditions. It was a daily thing for a while, but over a few weeks we finally seemed to level it out. Right on brand, it was time to upgrade the tank. Into the old hexfront it went. We used the rest of the substrate gravels to cover what substrate we transferred, and started the settling process again.            </p>
            <p>
                At this point we had a few plants sticking out of the back, and started to plant things we got from petsmart like Water Wysteria, etc. Things would boom and die off as the overall cycle set in on the tank.  There was once a group of 30 or so guppies that had worked up, and unfortunately we lost all but three in a big crash. currently we are standing at 3 guppies, 1 cory cat, at least 1 pleco, and many Blue Shrimps and snails. There are even a few freshwater clams who seem to be thriving!            </p>
            <p>
                Currently the no Filter Freshwater Aquarium is running with only an airstone, a wide assortment of plants, and a Phlizon black box light. The timer is currently malfunctioning so its on a "whenever I wake up and/or notice the reef light changing" schedule.
