We've all seen the PVC overflows all on the internet. There seem to be so many variations it can be overwhelming. I've been fascinated
by the idea of building one for myself for years, but only just now worked up the motivation to make it happen! My reef is about two years old at this point,
boasting a display capacity of 29 gallons. It was a tank I bought a few years ago at Petco during the famous dollar a gallon sale. It's been a side tank for most of the time ive owned it, stepping in for other tanks failing, etc. This is actually the second time this tank has seen this reef! The reef was started in a 10 gallon tank, which was moved into the current tank after a couple months in preparation for the REAL move. I put it all in a 55 gallon tank that was everything I dreamed of. of course it sprung a leak, so back into the 29 breeder! This tank turned out to be a really nice size. I would love to get it back into the 55, as the stand is originally built for that tank. I did some repairs on the leaks but just dont trust it enough to put the reef back in yet.

This brings me to the subject of todays bit. The DIY PVC OVERFLOW. It turned out to be one of those intimidating builds that made perfect sense once I started building. You want to pay attention to the inner diameter of the pipe you're using to make sure you have no flow issues. I lucked out and the pump I used matched my overflow siphon almost exactly. As of writing this, the overflow has been active and stable for 24 hours. 
////
I started with one 10 foot length of 3/4'od PVC and a few fittings. you could easily get away with using 8' or even 6', depending on your build. and of course, the diameter of the tube should be matched to your needs. For the weir, I used 1.5" PVC with one end capped. The area that does the skimming is a simple coupling with slots cut into it. This "Intake Skimmer" is one of the tuneable aspects of the overflow system. The diameter of the pipe used to construct the overall system determines the maximum amount of flow, etc, and the Skimmer Intake determines how fast the Weir refills itself. The level inside the weir provides the system with head pressure that assists the siphon, according to my working observations. 
////
The weir sits inside my tank, held against the intake tube (which is cut and slotted for flow) by the air inside the tube. The air is the result of the water level inside the weir. This level is determined by the balance of intake:outflow. A figure ive seen is that 3/4 inch PVC has been rated at a max of 220gph in this application, but have no record of my flow rates. I am using a pump from a 32 gallon BioCube. 
////
The intake tube takes water up and over the tank's edge from the bottom of the weir to the intake side of the sump. The Sump is where extra filtration or aquarium gear can go. Adding a sump or refugium increases your water volume, as well. This is desireable for overall stability. The overflow bends over the edge of the tank using two 90 degree fittings. On the top side of this bend, place a one-way air valve. this is used to start the system once its filled with water. Another 180 degree bend is placed BELOW the intake level. immediately after, a Tee is placed where the output is ABOVE the intake level. Mine is JUST ABOVE the end of the intake tube. In the vertival connector place another length of PVC that goes ABOVE the bend over the edge of the tank. this is used to fill the system with water before starting the syphon.

reefing journey- all the dead clownfish
minimal setup minimal filtration, ecosystem approach, etc

29 gallon breeder wasnt my first choice for a reef, but I've learned to love this one. My reefing journey is almost synonymous with my love of the aquarium hobby at this point. I spent many years wondering why my ten gallon reefs werent working out, only to come to realize that I was going WAY too fast and trying way too hard. Through this time I battled aiptastia and brown ick galore, not to mention all the critters that were subject to my ignorance. I have never done anything by the book, but there is so much information out there that it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the dosing, testing, and livestocking possibilities. 
//
I find myself giving advice I hated more than anything at this point-BE PATIENT- It's hard staring at an empty tank for months when all you want to do is grow the best corals in all the land. One of the beauties about the saltwater hobby is how things truly sweeten with time. Espectially if you are starting with dry or DEAD material, you are in for a long haul. It helps to have a contact in the hobby to start a tank but it sure is fullfilling to seed a tank over time. It becomes its own ecosystem with an ecological heierchy. while hitchhikers are a very bad deal and could take out a tank, I've been very pleased with the critter colony I've built up with this reef.
//
There is a massive colony of bloodworms wigglin in there, some snails, a variety of pod species, chaleurpa, lots of algae species, spaghetti works, feather dusters and all kinds of stuff I probably have no awareness of. While I do seem to have a massive bubble algae situation, I dont have any problem with it. I 'll let the new filtration work over time and employ the services of some livestock to hopefully balance things out. 
//
As of creating this area of the website, spell check didnt exist and the reef is running with a DIY PVC OVERFLOW and Return Pump setup with a Phlizon black box LED on a timer. two cycles of 5 hours a day. I run a very natural setup on all my tanks, which of course means i rarely test waters once things are running. Shoot for tank happiness. dont focus too much on all the "Rules" people post on the internet. be patient and just listen to what your specific tank needs. most of the time consistency is the best solution. ive found that most corals and livestock that survived a constistently bad situation ended up being lost to a sudden change made in hopes of fixing something.

freshwater stuff
//
freshwater aquariums were, as they were for many, my introduction into the aquarium hobby. the tanks I grew up around were often community tanks with an emphasis on guppys and angels. My dad taught me about things like guppy breeding, general fish lore and how to make sure the water was right. I understand water chemistry but still have a hard time forcing myself to loom over it and test regularly. On the other hand, guppies became my favorite fish to keep, and are a staple in my freshwater systems. They're even in the paladarium! We didnt keep many plants in the aquarium as far as I remember, that part of my obsession must have come later. I remember having guppies and mollies and doing the whole breederbox process, eagerly waiting to see the live babies pour out of the poor mother. 
//
Through life I have started countless aquatic projects in all shapes. I once kept a tupperware full of water in my bedroom that housed some ground cover, a tiger lotus and a few goldfish. I slept on the floor but I had my koipond! Looking back I guess i've been more interested in aquariums than I realized, and I'm glad its still a part of my life.

My current Freshwater Setup:
36 gallon hex front, Planted, No Filter

This Tank is about a year and a half old. It, like the 29gal Reef, was started in a 10 gallon tank. It had some of the current driftwood, a large quartz rock, and fertilized substrate. the substrate was organic potting soil held down with the current gravels. When I do it again I'll be sure to use more gravels to create a better barrier and/or focus on sourcing some reccomended aquarium dirt. It was a hot mess. Of course we started in the dreaded ten gallon, so water changes were only doing so much. Luckily we're on good well water so we rarely have to worry about raw water conditions. It was a daily thing for a while, but over a few weeks we finally seemed to level it out. Right on brand, it was time to upgrade the tank. Into the old hexfront it went. We used the rest of the substrate gravels to cover what substrate we transferred, and started the settling process again.
//
At this point we had a few plants sticking out of the back, and started to plant things we got from petsmart like Water Wysteria, etc. Things would boom and die off as the overall cycle set in on the tank.  There was once a group of 30 or so guppies that had worked up, and unfortunately we lost all but three in a big crash. currently we are standing at 3 guppies, 1 cory cat, at least 1 pleco, and many Blue Shrimps and snails. There are even a few freshwater clams who seem to be thriving!
//
Currently the no Filter Freshwater Aquarium is running with only an airstone, a wide assortment of plants, and a Phlizon black box light. The timer is currently malfunctioning so its on a "whenever I wake up and/or notice the reef light changing" schedule.

plants in this system:
duckweed
red tiger lotus
red Cryptocoryne wendtii
anubias nana
Marimo Balls
River moss from a local River
various pothos
